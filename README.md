### What we learned

<!-- write here what you learnt during work on the project -->

- **Sopo**: Learned how to work on a project in team: How to work with different git commands to separate work into branches, how to update branches according to the newest version of the code. I also learned how to manage a team of several devs, how to distribute tasks, how to merge different branches into main and resolve merge conflicts. Code vise, I revisitted event delegation concept. Overall, I got a hands-on experience with the realistic workflow of team projects.
- **Anastasia**: Learned XYZ

- **Sopo**: I plan to improve my understanding on conflict resolution during merges mainly.
- **Anastasia**: XYZ
